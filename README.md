About Calculator App

ðŸ§  Case Study: Building Calculator Software in Python<br/>
    ðŸ”¹ BasicCalculator()     - Basic arithmetic operations<br/>
    ðŸ”¹ FinancialCalculator() - Inherits from BasicCalculator + Method for financial calculation<br/>
    ðŸ”¹ MortgageCalculator()  - Inherits from FinancialCalculator<br/>
    It's a project that I learned how to build app in Python, and also learned about types of inheritance.<br/>

    In terminal, to deploy to my-calc-app repo:
    cd path/to/my-calc-app
    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-calc-app.git
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit for my calculator Flask app"
    git push -u origin main

    I've now published my-calc-app repo to GitHub, so I want to deploy this app to<br/>
    ðŸ”¹ Render.com<br/>
        https://my-calc-app.onrender.com<br/>
    ðŸ”¹ Railway.app : I cannot deploy the code, due to the "Limited Trail".<br/>
